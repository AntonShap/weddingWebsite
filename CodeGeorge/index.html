            <p class="OS-light p">
                Our love story began in London 2017. Anton was trying to make it as a 
                project manager while Cristina was a junior doctor in a nearby hospital. 
                Some flirtatious banter was exchanged back and forth followed 
                by a date in Hyde Parks’ Winter Wonderland, mulled wine and late 
                chat in a tent next to an open fire… 
                well the rest is history! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Four years worth of memories and we’ve been frozen on top of the Eifel Tower, 
                rained on in Venice and survived the Canary Islands cuisine. We’ve also called 
                3 places our home and seriously upped our home coffee game. 
                <br>
                <br>                
                Last summer Anton organised a picnic in Hyde Park and asked us to 
                dress up as we were to feed the parakeets and you never know when you’ll 
                end up snapping that perfect picture. We “incidentally” wondered of to the 
                same place where our first date took place and there he popped the question… 
                <br>
                <br>
                Cristina said YES! We can’t wait for this exciting new chapter to begin!

                For the special day we invite you to join us in Sveta Nedelq Church at 4 pm, 
                please arrive a few minutes early if you want to be in all the pictures. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The origin of the name Sveta Nedelya is rather obscure. 
                It can be translated as either "Holy Sunday", "Saint Nedelya", or even as 
                "Saint Sunday". It’s is a medieval church that has suffered destruction 
                through the ages and has been reconstructed many times. The present 
                building of the temple is among the landmarks of Sofia and it’s also 
                celebrating its 700th anniversary 
                on our wedding day! How about that…

                We are still ironing the details out but there are a few things we know:
                <br>
                - the attire will be semi-formal 
                <br>
                - we will keep the RSVP open until the end of July 
                <br>
                - we will try to update this page with the seating arrangement before THE big day
                <br>
                <br> 
                And make sure you bring your dance shoes as we will dance the night away
