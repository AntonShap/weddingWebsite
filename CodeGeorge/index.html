            <hr>
            <p>
                Our love story began in London 2017. Anton was trying to make it as a project manager while Cristina was
                a junior doctor in a nearby hospital. Some flirtatious banter was exchanged back and forth followed by a
                date in Hyde Parksâ€™ Winter Wonderland, mulled wine and late chat in a tent next to an open fireâ€¦
                well the rest is history! Four years worth of memories and weâ€™ve been frozen on top of the Eifel
                Tower, rained on in Venice and survived the Canary Islands cuisine. Weâ€™ve also called 3 places our
                home and seriously upped our home coffee game. Last summer Anton organised a picnic in Hyde Park and
                asked us to dress up as we were to feed the parakeets and you never know when youâ€™ll end up snapping
                that perfect picture. We â€œincidentallyâ€ wondered of to the same place where our first date took
                place and there he popped the questionâ€¦ Cristina said YES! We canâ€™t wait for this exciting new
                chapter to begin!

                For the special day we invite you to join us in Sveta Nedelq Church at 4 pm, please arrive a few minutes
                early if you want to be on all the pictures. The origin of the name Sveta Nedelya is rather obscure. It
                can be translated as either "Holy Sunday", "Saint Nedelya", or even as "Saint Sunday". Itâ€™s is a
                medieval church that has suffered destruction through the ages and has been reconstructed many times.
                The present building of the temple is among the landmarks of Sofia and itâ€™s also celebrating its 700th
                anniversary on our wedding day! How about thatâ€¦

                catch a flower bouquet ;) ... When you are ready you may join us in hotel Balkan (behind the church) for
                a complimentary drink. This will be your first opportunity to mingle with other guests and get to know
                them before the reception starts. Go to hotels reception and confirm you are a guest of Cristina and
                Antonâ€™s wedding. Hotel staff will help you find your way to the other guests and a glass of bubbly.

                As this is a destination event for some of you do bear in mind we are here to help. If you decide to
                stay in the same hotel as the reception we’d be happy to cover the expense for the night of the wedding
                and make sure you are getting preferential prices for the rest of the stay.
